Data and Audience
Depending on the specifics of your project, you should outline the answers to these (and perhaps other) questions:

What is the dataset you’ll be working with? Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.
Who is your target audience? Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should home in on one of these audiences.
What does your audience want to learn from your data? Please list out at least 3 specific questions that your project will answer for your audience.

Technical Description
This section of your proposal asks you to think through the specific analytical steps you’ll need to complete throughout the project.

How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)?
- we'll use a static .csv file 

What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?
- the .csv format will be basically ready to use in rstudio, but: 
- we can order the data by incident level (level 1, 2, 3) to create a ranking 
- will have to edit date/time into new columns (create column for date and time separately)

What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)
What questions, if any, will you be answering with statistical analysis/machine learning?
- We will use the tidyverse package, in order to utilize readr, stringr, magrittr, and ggplot2

What major challenges do you anticipate?
- A challenge will be deciding what to plot, and how to best visualise the data for the audience 
- Additionally, figuring out how to create a map of the data in rstudio 

Project Set-up
In addition to outlining the steps you’ll be taking to complete the project, you’ll also be setting up your project on GitHub by doing the following:

Create a public repository on GitHub in which you’ll be completing your final projects. All group members should be added to the repo so they can push directly to it
Create 5 GitHub Issues as your first set of steps to take in the project. You should assign these to individual group members to complete
