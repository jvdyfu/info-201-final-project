Data and Audience
Depending on the specifics of your project, you should outline the answers to these (and perhaps other) questions:

What is the dataset you’ll be working with? Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.
- the data set we will be working with is the "Use of Force" in he seattle police department. This data is a compilation of date and time, incident number, incident type, precinct, sector, and beat (type of beating), officer ID, subject ID, subject race, and subject gender. The data was provided by the City of Seattle by a dataset owner named 6506 Tony Baden. The data was collected in 2017 but has been updated as of late on February 14, 2023. 
Who is your target audience? Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should home in on one of these audiences.
- The target audience is people who are interested in the role of police in communities, police reform/abolition, the effectiveness of the use of force policy, the presence of policing of certain marginalized communities, and more. 
What does your audience want to learn from your data? Please list out at least 3 specific questions that your project will answer for your audience.
- Is there a racialized pattern for police's use of force?
- What precinct contains the highest proportion of BIPOC communities and how is it policed in comparison to non-BIPOC precincts?
- Is there a correlation between gender and the use of force?
Technical Description
This section of your proposal asks you to think through the specific analytical steps you’ll need to complete throughout the project.

How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)?
What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?
What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)
What questions, if any, will you be answering with statistical analysis/machine learning?
What major challenges do you anticipate?
Project Set-up
In addition to outlining the steps you’ll be taking to complete the project, you’ll also be setting up your project on GitHub by doing the following:

Create a public repository on GitHub in which you’ll be completing your final projects. All group members should be added to the repo so they can push directly to it
Create 5 GitHub Issues as your first set of steps to take in the project. You should assign these to individual group members to complete
